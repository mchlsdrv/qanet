Execution Instructions:

    - Build Train / Test Data:
        Builds data in a form of list of tuples (image, segmentation, augmented segmentation, Jaccard(segmentation, augmented_segmentation))
        
        Expected Input Data Format:
            1) The files are expected to be located in two separate directories (i.e., one for images and one for corresponding segemtnations), 
            where the directory with the segmentations should have the same name as the directory with the images, but with 'MASK' postfix 
            (e.g., "01" with images and "01_MASK" with the corresponding masks). 
            2) Each image and the corresponding mask file should have "image0" and "mask0" prefixes respectively (e.g., "image01.tif" and 
            "mask01.tif", where the image prefix is "img0", and segmentation prefix is "mask0" etc.)**

            EXAMPLE:
                DATA ROOT - 
                    01 - 
                        image01.tif
                        image02.tif
                        image03.tif
                           ...
                    01_MASK - 
                        mask01.tif
                        mask02.tif
                        mask03.tif
                           ...
                    02 - 
                        image01.tif
                        image02.tif
                        image03.tif
                           ...
                    02_MASK - 
                        mask01.tif
                        mask02.tif
                        mask03.tif
                           ...
                    ...

        - (*) Flags:

            --output_data_dir (str) - Path to the directory where the output images and segmentations will be placed
            --seg_dir_postfix (str) - The postfix of the directories with the segmentations (as described above)

            --plot_samples (flag) - If to plot the generated samples (takes considerable amount of time)

        - (**) To ensure your format fits the models' format (the format of the data dir may be changed at './configs/general_configs.py'), 
        in the beggining run the 'format_data_dir.py' with flags:
            - current_seg_dir_postfix (str) - the postfix of the folder(s) with the segmentations
            - current_image_prefix (str) - the prefix of the images
            - current_seg_prefix (str) - the prefix of the segmentations

           

    - Train / Test / Infer:
        - Before running one of the train / test procedures - data must be build with the:
            python build_data.py

        - Run the desired procedure and implementation by executing:
            python tf/torch_PROCEDURE.py (tf for the TensorFlow and torch for the PyTorch implementations respectively)
